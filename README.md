# Code name: Black Fang, after the crimson mead that fueled the creation of this app

## What is it?

Black Fang is an application built to facilitate an approach to dance collaboration. Specifically in idea generation.

This is based on a model called Distance Dances, created by Gina T'ai. It is a remixing system.

1. Each participant uploads an origin video.
2. Users respond with another video that remixes elements from 2-3 other videos.
3. Rinse, repeat.

After several iterations the goup develops a shared vocabulary from which to pull and curate to create a coreography.

## Guts

Built on rails 5.1 with React views, using weboacker.

PostgreSQL database, RSpec test suite with Factory Girl and Faker.
